What Is Burp Suite?

Burp Suite is a suite of tools from PortSwigger designed to aid in the penetration testing of web applications over both HTTP and HTTPS. The primary tool is a proxy designed to allow the analysis and editing of web traffic. The proxy can intercept web requests and responses and read and edit them in real-time before they reach their respective destinations. Versions are available for Windows, MacOS, and Linux, along with a JAR file.

Many of the tools included in Burp Suite are designed to integrate with the main proxy and can have requests imported to them. Intruder allows you to import a request and then configure arrange of payloads to attempt and can then run through them automatically. Repeater allows you to import a web request and then make manual modifications to it and see the response side by side allowing you to make minor adjustments to attempted exploits and easily see if itâ€™s working. A dashboard feature shows a list of identified issues, although these need to be manually checked for false positives.
