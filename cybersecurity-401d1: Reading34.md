What is Computer Forensics? 

Computer forensics and cybersecurity are actually different, cybersecurity is focused on prevention while computer forensics is reactionary in nature. Cybersecurity experts work to keep hackers out, while computer forensics experts focus on how to move forward once a hacker has gotten in.

In the world of computer forensics, there are important responsibilities involved with correctly conducting an investigation and gaining knowledge about a breach or hack. There are six stages of a computer forensics examination looking for information or evidence involving cyber crime. 

Readiness. This stage helps the investigator make sure they are ready to take on investigation at any time. They ensure everyone has been trained correctly, ensure they understand legal ramifications of investigations, plan ahead for technical and non-technical issues, and make sure their equipment is ready anytime. 

Evaluation. This happens when a team is given information about an investigation. They assign roles and resources to the team, get details on facts and particulars about the case, and identify risks of the investigation. 

Collection. This involves the collection of evidence and learning about the cyber attack or cyber crime. Many tools and techniques are used to obtain this data, and can involve conducting interviews, obtaining the hard drives and other devices, and more. Devices are sealed in evidence bags to be further evaluated at the forensics lab. 

Analysis. This part of the investigation is vital to success. Evidence and data collected are analyzed to get as much information as possible about the breach or crime. This can involve who performed the crime, when it happened, what data was lost, digital evidence, and more. The analysis must be accurate, must be documented and recorded, it must be unbiased, and it must meet correct deadlines. 

Presentation. After analysis, the team presents a summary of its findings. They offer strategies to companies to help them increase their security and prevent issues in the future. A presentation will also be given to a court of law that needs details about the forensics evidence. 

Review. After the process is completed, the forensics team will do a review of how their investigation went, talk about things to improve in the future, and evaluate how to better serve in the next investigation.

There are many duties a cyber forensics expert may have in their day including:

Conduct data breach investigations

Recover and examine data from computers or electronics

Identify additional systems or networks that may have been compromised

Compile evidence for legal cases

Draft technical reports and write declarations to prepare evidence for trial.
