Threat modelling works to identify, communicate, and understand threats and mitigations within the context of protecting something of value.

Threat modelling can be applied to a wide range of things, including software, applications, systems, networks, distributed systems, things in the internet of things, business processes, etc. There are very few technical products which cannot be threat modelled; more or less rewarding, depending on how much it communicates, or interacts, with the world. Threat modelling can be done at any stage of development, preferably early - so that the findings can inform the design.

A threat model includes:

A description / design / model of what youâ€™re worried about
A list of assumptions that can be checked or challenged in the future as the threat landscape changes
A list of potential threats to the system
A list of actions to be taken for each threat
A way of validating the model and threats, and verification of success of actions taken
