The CISO Perspective

First developed by Lockheed Martin, the Cybersecurity Kill Chain is a model for describing the steps an attacker must complete to carry a successful attack. This model is made up of 7 sequential steps:

Reconnaissance
Weaponization
Delivery
Exploitation
Installation
Command and Control
Actions on Objectives

Reconnaissance
 
The first step of any cybersecurity attack is to gather information about the victim, also known as reconnaissance. 

The two different stages of reconnaissance are passive and active. 

Weaponization
 
Once an attacker has found a weakness, their next step is find or create the attack that will exploit the vulnerability. The weapon of choice will depend on the info they collected from you during the reconnaissance step. 
 
Delivery
 
By this point, the attacker has selected the weapon based on their earlier reconnaissance. Now, the delivery stage is where they try one or multiple avenues to deliver the weapon. The delivery of the attack varies by the type of attack. Some examples of delivery channels are: 
 
Exploitation
 

During the exploitation stage, the attacker has effectively delivered the weapon of choice to the victim and the attack has been executed. This means we have failed to keep the weapon away from our environment, and the only thing left is for the attacker to pull the trigger. 
 

Installation
 
The exploitation and Installation phase go hand in hand. A successful exploit allows me to  inject a payload that will give me a better level of access to accomplish the mission. From an attackers perspective, gaining better access allows me to control the victim at any point in the future, even after a system has been patched.  
 
Command and Control

At this stage, the system has been completely compromised and in control of the attacker. If they completed the previous stage correctly, their access is persistent â€“ even if you reboot or patch the vulnerability.
