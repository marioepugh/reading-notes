The NSA released a tool for reverse-engineering Generally, reverse-engineering (RE) refers to the process of taking something apart to figure out how it was made. 
That’s where Ghidra comes in to play. It’s a toolbox for taking software apart to see how it ticks. There are already other similar tools like IDA, Radare, and Binary Ninja.

The NSA uses Ghidra to take about viruses, malware, and other programs that may pose a threat to national security.

With the number of state-sponsored hacking events in the news recently, this useful tool will help many people.
