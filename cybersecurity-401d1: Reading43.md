 Sniffing and its Types
 
 What is Sniffing?
Sniffing is a process of monitoring and capturing all data packets passing through given network. Sniffers are used by network/system administrator to monitor and troubleshoot network traffic. Attackers use sniffers to capture data packets containing sensitive information such as password, account information etc. Sniffers can be hardware or software installed in the system. By placing a packet sniffer on a network in promiscuous mode, a malicious intruder can capture and analyze all of the network traffic.

There are two types:
Active Sniffing:
Sniffing in the switch is active sniffing. A switch is a point to point network device. The switch regulates the flow of data between its ports by actively monitoring the MAC address on each port, which helps it pass data only to its intended target. In order to capture the traffic between target sniffers has to actively inject traffic into the LAN to enable sniffing of the traffic.  This can be done in various ways.

Passive Sniffing:
This is the process of sniffing through the hub. Any traffic that is passing through the non-switched or unbridged network segment can be seen by all machines on that segment. Sniffers operate at the data link layer of the network. Any data sent across the LAN is actually sent to each and every machine connected to the LAN. This is called passive since sniffers placed by the attackers passively wait for the data to be sent and capture them.
