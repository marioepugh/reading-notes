The Pros & Cons of Intrusion Detection Systems

A network intrusion detection system (NIDS) is an integral part of an organization’s security in a cohesive and safe system.

Intrusion detection systems are a lot like fire alarms. Just as a fire alarm detects smoke, an intrusion detection system identifies incidents and potential threats. They are incredibly useful for raising awareness, but if you don’t hear the alarm or react appropriately, your house may burn down.

While a firewall is there to keep out malicious attacks, an IDS is there to detect whether someone or something is trying up to suspicious or nefarious activity. When it detects something, it notifies the system administrator.

An IDS is a visibility tool that sits off to the side of the network and monitors traffic. It consists of a management console and sensors. When the sensors encounter something that matches up to a previously detected attack signature, they report the activity to the console. An IDS can notify security personnel of infections, spyware or key loggers, as well as accidental information leakage, security policy violations, unauthorized clients and servers, and even configuration errors.
