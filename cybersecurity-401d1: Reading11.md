Wireshark is useful for sniffing packets traveling across your network. It can be used to steal authorization passwords since those passwords are transmitted across the network. All the packets on the network that actually arrive at your PCs (or Mac) will be inspected to check if they have a destination that matches the network card if the destination address is a match, the packets are destined for your PC and will be passed up to the CPU and processed if the destination address in the packet does not match the address of the network card the packets will simply be ignored and discarded. 

To gain information for another network not your own you need to get physical access to the path of the packets, or you can’t capture any of them. So if you want to capture packets with someone’s Facebook password in it, you need to either be physically connected to the network they’re using, e.g. when it’s also your own home or work network and you’re spying on your family or on coworkers physically connected to the Facebook network.
Physically connected to any network in between those two, e.g. your friends Internet Service Provider (ISP). Well, have you ever tried to get into a data center where nobody knows you? Yeah, that won’t happen. Capture plain text wireless packets while sitting close to someone you want to steal credentials from, e.g. in an unencrypted WiFi of a coffee shop.
