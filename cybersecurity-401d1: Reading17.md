What Red Teams need to know about the Mitre ATT&CK framework.

Developed by Mitre Corp., has been around for five years and is a living, growing document of threat tactics and techniques that have been observed from millions of attacks on enterprise networks. The acronym stands for Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge. It began as an internal project and morphed into this behemoth of a public knowledge base that numerous security vendors and consultants have picked up.

The goal of the Mitre researchers is to break down and classify attacks in a consistent and clear manner that can make it easier to compare and contrast them to find how the attacker exploited your networks and endpoints and penetrated your network.

As adversaries get more skilled, defenders have to up their game too. By classifying attacks into discreet units, itâ€™s easier for researchers to see common patterns, figure out who authored different campaigns, and track how a piece of malware has evolved over the years as the author added new features and attack methods.
