Average time taken to patch High Severity Vulnerability
34 days

Average time taken to patch Medium Severity Vulnerability
39 days

Top five incidents: tCell vs. OWASP
In tCell’s analysis,their top five attacks differ from OWASP’s top five. The main reason for this is that tCell protects applications in-production that reside in the AWS, Azure and Google cloud environments. This gives them a unique perspective on application security in production, and the nature of the attacks themselves.
