The reading was how to Apply the CIA Triad to your Enterprise File Network and What are MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-256 Hashed and How do I Check Them. CIA stands for confidentiality, integrity and availability, which are the building blocks of information security. In order to establish a secure system you want confidentiality as you might not want competitors to know your trade secrets. You want integrity which is the principle of preventing data from being tampered. And availability issues can be a serious problem, especially if they involve business critical data. 

MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-256 are all different hash functions, you can use to download a file and run the hash function to confirm you have the real original file and it was not corrupted. By default SHA-256 will be used for a hash file unless a different algorithm is selected.
